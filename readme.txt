Learning REACT!!

I am learning REACT via TreeHouse and this repo is from the course. When I first started learning REACT I tried to build my enviroment and found that it was not as easy as it looked. So I decided to build everything in my current enviorment, and test it in theirs.

You can see the programs that I built in TreeHouse if you look in the public folder. Enjoy! :)
